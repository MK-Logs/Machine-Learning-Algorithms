# Machine Learning Algorithms

The Decision Tree and K-Means Clustering algorithms were developed and implemented from scratch for my graduate ML coursework. Both the algorithms had 90+% accuracy given the test datasets and were comparable in accuracy with regards to existing ML libraries that implement these algorithms such as SciKit-Learn.
